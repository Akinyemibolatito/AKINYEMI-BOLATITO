Market Basket Analysis Project
Overview
This project focused on leveraging Market Basket Analysis techniques using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend. Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to identify patterns and associations between products or items frequently purchased together.

Table of Contents
Introduction
I undertook a project that involved applying Market Basket Analysis techniques using Python and various libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend. The primary aim of Market Basket Analysis is to uncover patterns and associations between items frequently bought together in transactions.

Installation
I ensured that Python was installed, and I cloned the repository for the project. I then installed the required dependencies using the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
cd market-basket-analysis

# Installed dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
For running the market basket analysis, I executed the main script with the path to the transaction data:


python main.py --input_data transactions.csv --output_results results.csv
I adjusted parameters such as support, confidence, and lift based on the specific requirements of the analysis.

Data
The dataset used for this analysis consisted of transactional data, where each row represented a unique transaction, and the columns corresponded to the purchased items. I provided details about the source of the data, format, and any preprocessing steps performed.

Analysis
The analysis involved several steps, including data loading, preprocessing, applying the Apriori algorithm using the mlxtend library, and interpreting the results. Example code snippets were included in the README:

python
# Load data
import pandas as pd
transactions = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')

# Preprocess data

# Apply Apriori algorithm
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules
frequent_itemsets = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.05, use_colnames=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1)
Results
I summarized key findings and insights obtained from the market basket analysis, including the discovered association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.

Entire process flow
# Hotel-resevation-dataset
The hotel reservation dataset offers a detailed exploration of booking dynamics, customer behaviors, and revenue patterns within the hospitality industry. Spanning a timeframe from 2015 to 2017, the dataset encompasses diverse dimensions of hotel operations, shedding light on occupancy rates, pricing dynamics, booking channels, room types, and cancellation trends.

1. Average Daily Rate (ADR) Trends:
The dataset unravels the temporal evolution of Average Daily Rate (ADR), exposing substantial spikes in revenue, notably on January 7, 2015. Seasonal patterns also emerge, with November standing out as a peak booking period, potentially attributed to the proximity of Christmas celebrations.

ADR BY ARRIVAL DATE ANALYSIS
Analyzing Average Daily Rate (ADR) by arrival date in a hotel reservation dataset is a key aspect of booking analysis.
the highest spike in revenue was recorded on the 7th of january 2015at higher than 800 and could have been due to a number of reasons ,such as during special events, holidays, or peak seasons and the lowest average revenue generated was on the 7th of march 2017 at 0.
 
Looking through for seasonal patterns, November which is close to the christmas celebration period seems like the highest time for booking with the highest revenue generated closely followed by january. The december periods seemed less engaging which is likely because people spend the festive periods with family.

This Pricing Dynamics should be shuffled between those peak and low months to attract more bookings at low peak periods.

ADR by assigned Room type and type of customer: The trasient party customers contribute the highest to the revenue of the company, closely followed by the trainsent customers and they mostly order for room A, which in turn ends up being the most revenue generating room, the least generating room,at more than 5kn revenue generationG is still booked by trasient party customers however it degenerates way less than 2k 


2. ADR by Assigned Room Type :
Analyzing ADR by room type and customer segment reveals that Transient-Party customers dominate revenue generation, primarily favoring Room A. Transient-Party customers not only contribute the highest total ADR but also exhibit the highest average ADR. The dataset underscores the need for strategic alignment with the preferences of this lucrative customer segment.
Transient-Party has the highest total ADR at $7,577.51. This indicates that, overall, this customer type contributes the most to the hotel's revenue.
Following Transient-Party, there are Transient, Contract, and Group in descending order, suggesting their respective contributions to the total revenue.

3.Proportion of ADR by Customer Type:
ADR by Customer Type:
Among the customer types, Transient-Party represents 33.26% of the total ADR. This indicates that, despite being the highest in total revenue, Transient-Party's share of the ADR is a significant portion of the overall revenue.
Average ADR by Customer Type:

Transient-Party again leads in terms of average ADR with $947.19. This means that, on average, each booking in the Transient-Party category generates a higher ADR compared to other customer types.
The descending order of average ADR is maintained with Transient, Contract, and Group following.
Analysis:

Transient-Party Dominance: The Transient-Party customer type is the most lucrative for the hotel, contributing the highest total revenue, having the highest average ADR, and making up a significant proportion of the overall ADR. This could imply that the hotel is well-positioned or equipped to cater to this specific customer segment, and there might be opportunities to further capitalize on this popularity.

Diversification: While Transient-Party is dominant, it's essential to maintain a balance among customer types. Diversification can mitigate risks associated with dependency on a single segment and could help in optimizing revenue streams.

Pricing Strategy: The high average ADR for Transient-Party suggests that this customer type is willing to pay a premium for the services provided. The hotel might consider fine-tuning its pricing strategy for other customer types to maximize overall revenue without compromising customer satisfaction.

Marketing and Service Alignment: Understanding the characteristics of Transient-Party guests could inform marketing strategies to attract similar customers. Additionally, ensuring that services and amenities align with the preferences of Transient-Party guests could enhance their experience and encourage repeat business.

Continuous Monitoring: The hotel should continue to monitor customer preferences, market dynamics, and booking patterns to adapt strategies accordingly. Regularly analyzing and adjusting pricing, marketing efforts, and service offerings can help maintain competitiveness in the hospitality industry.




4. Booking Channels Analysis:
Delving into booking channels, the dataset exposes the dominance of corporate bookings, followed by the influential role of Travel Agents/Operators (TA/TO). Direct bookings, though representing a smaller share, emphasize the importance of tailored strategies to encourage customers to book directly. The dataset advocates for a strategic approach, leveraging diverse channels for optimal revenue generation.

Process FLOW: 
Use a Pie chart or Bar chart to visualize the distribution of bookings across different channels.

Pie Chart:

Values: Count of bookings for each distribution channel
Labels: Distribution channel names (e.g., TA, TO, etc.)
Legend: Distribution channel names

Here's a simple illustration of the DAX code i used  to create a count of bookings by distribution channel:


Process:
BookingChannelsCount = 
SUMMARIZE(
     hotel_bookings,
hotel_bookings[distribution_channel],
    "BookingCount", COUNTROWS(hotel_bookings)
from which i got the error below The expression refers to multiple columns. Multiple columns cannot be converted to a scalar value.

BookingChannelsCount = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(
        VALUES( hotel_bookings[distribution_channel]),
        COUNTROWS( hotel_bookings)
    )
)

)

which then worked.


 Analysis of Booking Channels:

 Overview:
   - The Booking Channels analysis provides insights into how hotel bookings are distributed among various channels. The channels include Direct bookings, Travel Agents/Operators (TA/TO), and Corporate bookings, among others.

Key Findings:
Corporate Dominance:Corporate bookings have the highest BookingChannelsCount, representing 60.83% of total bookings. This suggests a significant portion of the hotel's clientele comes from corporate entities.
   
TA/TO Influence: Travel Agents/Operators (TA/TO) contribute significantly, with a BookingChannelsCount of 29.49%. This indicates the importance of partnerships with travel agencies in driving bookings.

Direct Bookings: Direct bookings, possibly through the hotel's website or other direct channels, account for 9.22% of the total. While this percentage is lower, it signifies a notable portion of customers who prefer booking directly.

GDS Contribution: Global Distribution System (GDS) shows a smaller share at 0.46%. This might represent a niche market or specific partnerships.

Count of Bookings by Country:
The dataset highlights booking counts by country, with Portugal (PRT) leading at 82, followed by Austria (AUT) and France (FRA). PRT contributes significantly, accounting for 37.79% of total bookings.

 Conclusion:
   - The Booking Channels analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how different channels contribute to hotel 
bookings. Leveraging these insights will empower the hotel to optimize strategies, enhance guest experiences, and drive overall business success.




5. Room Type Occupancy Patterns:
A detailed examination of room type occupancy through a stacked bar chart reveals nuanced insights into booking preferences over time. November emerges as a peak booking period, with Room A displaying the highest occupancy.

PROCESS FLOW: 
Room Type Occupancy:**
   - Stacked bar chart illustrating the occupancy rates for different room types over time.

To analyze Room Type Occupancy and create a stacked bar chart illustrating occupancy rates for different room types over time, you would need the following key columns:

arrival_date_year:

This column is essential for grouping bookings by year, allowing you to observe trends over different years.
arrival_date_month:

This column is necessary for creating a time series, helping you identify monthly patterns and seasonality.
arrival_date_week_number:

Useful for a more granular analysis, showing variations within each year based on week numbers.
arrival_date_day_of_month:

Provides daily granularity, allowing you to observe occupancy trends within each month.
reserved_room_type:

The room type reserved by the guest, which is crucial for categorizing bookings into different room types.
is_canceled:

To filter out canceled bookings and focus on actual occupancy.
Using these columns, you can filter data based on the booked room type and create a stacked bar chart where each bar represents a specific time period (month, week, or day), and the segments within the bar represent different room types.

X-Axis: Time (Year/Month/Week/Day)
Y-Axis: Count of Bookings(which is Total Bookings = COUNTROWS('YourTableName') or TotalBookings = SUM(YourTable[is_canceled])
I went with the latter to field off canceled bookings.
Stacked Bars: Different room types (segments within each bar)

For example: from the stacked bar, november has the most arrival /booking date across the 3 years and room A shows that the most occupied room is A



6. Average Room Rate Trends:
